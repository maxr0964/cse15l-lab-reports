# Lab Report 4 - Racing Task
**Step 4: Logging in to IENG**
* Screenshot:
* To run the <code>ssh</code> command, I repeatedly hit <code><up arrow></code> to get the command out of the terminal's history and then hit <code><enter></code>. I did not have to enter a password for the ssh command because I set up an <code>ssh</code> key for my account on <code>ieng6</code>.
  
**Step 5: Cloning the repository**
* Screenshot:
* To run <code>git clone</code>, I repeatedly hit <code><up arrow></code> to get the command out of the terminal's history and then hit <code><enter></code>. I found this to be faster than using <code>ctrl-R</code>, because the number of key presses is about the same but there is less chance of mistakes when typing.
