# Lab Report 1
**Step 1: Installing VScode**
* To install VSCode, visit this link: https://code.visualstudio.com/ and follow the install instructions for your OS.
*Note: I didn't do this step during the lab, as I already had VSCode installed on my computer.*

**Step 2: Remotely Connecting**
* If you're using windows, this step requires you to install git. Follow the instructions at this link: https://gitforwindows.org/
* After installing git, set the terminal in VScode to use git bash by opening the command palette with control-shift-p and selecting Git Bash as the default profile
* Next, connect to the <code>ieng6</code> server by typing: <code>ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu</code> (zz should be replaced by the three letters of your course-specific account).
* If it's your first time connecting to the server, type yes when prompted, and then enter your password when prompted.
* Once you're logged in, you should see a message such as <code># Now on remote server</code>.
*Note: I didn't install git during the lab, as I already had it on my computer.*
